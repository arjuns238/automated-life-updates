I visited northeastern US (only Boston though) for the first time. Finally, I went to the art museum a few times and also saw some stunning fireworks on July 4th.","This summer I reconnected with hobbies — cooking and baking (inari-style sushi, pork‑daikon pastries, and a cozy noodle soup), tried some clay sculpting and plant care, took my first trip to Boston, spent afternoons at the art museum, and ended it with stunning July 4th fireworks 🎆
